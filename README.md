<p>This is place where we manage our code.</p>

<h3>Using terminal</h3>
<li>
<p>Use <code>cd mydirecotry</code> command go to the directory where you want to place the code.</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Paste <code>git clone https://github.com/zhiyzuo/beta.git</code> into your terminal and hit <kbd>enter</kbd></p>
</li>

<h3>Using GUI</h3>
<p>I personally do not use GUI. Please go to <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for more details.</p>

<hr>

<p>If your computer runs <b>Windows</b>, you probably would need to install <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> first.<p>

<hr>

<p>I have not had time to figure out how to implement <code>insert into user ...</code> now. 
If you have got any ideas, please go head and update the codes and push it back with proper comments.
You can also edit this page for demonstration.</p>

<p>However, before you can push this back here, you have to let me add you into the collaborators' list. Just <a href="mailto:zhiya-zuo@uiowa.edu?Subject=Github%20Beta%20Issues" target="_top">send</a> me an email.</p>
